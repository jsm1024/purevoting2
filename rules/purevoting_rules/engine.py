"""Deterministic rules over explicit, complete, cumulative local audit inputs.

No network I/O is hidden in this module. The caller supplies contract-shaped rows,
accepted LedgerEvents and Gateway Rejections for one committed checkpoint. The
adapter must fetch every page and select the requested as-of views. Local guards
detect visible contradictions (future row checkpoints or a known historical commit
omitted from events); they cannot prove that an external response is complete.
R1–R3 implement the frozen predicates on that evidence. R4/R5 deliberately expose
partial coverage; a clean local subset can never be reported as a complete PASS.
