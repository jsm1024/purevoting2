# core/ — Core API (owner: Seungmin)

Implements `contracts/core-api.openapi.yaml`. Role design: `docs/roles/core-web.md`. Work log (Korean): `DEVLOG.ko.md`.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `app/main.py` | FastAPI app, routers, background loops (scheduler, outbox worker) |
| `app/routes_public.py` | voter endpoints (public election, redeem, ballots, receipts) and staff login |
| `app/routes_staff.py` | staff endpoints: elections, roster, freeze, link CSV, staff views, alerts |
| `app/routes_internal.py` | `/internal/v1/*`: elections, checkpoints, views, findings, audit alerts |
| `app/elections.py` | election creation (key pair, `config_hash`, registry), roster, freeze (D-10), token issue |
| `app/voting.py` | redeem (one transaction across both schemas) and ballots (idempotent) |
| `app/lifecycle.py` | checkpoints (six snapshot tables) and boundary transitions: open, PERIODIC, close + CLOSE_FINAL |
| `app/ledger.py`, `app/outbox.py` | ledger events into the outbox; delivery per time bucket, outcome handling |
| `app/views.py` | the seven views "as of checkpoint k" |
| `app/findings.py`, `app/schemas.py` | finding storage (single acceptance condition), JSON Schema checks against `contracts/` |
| `app/creation_check.py` | creation check; `stub` mode until week 3 |
| `app/hashing.py` | `contracts/hashing.md` (H, Hc, Merkle, roots, signature digests) |
| `app/scripts/create_staff.py` | staff-account setup script (no account API) |
| `devtools/fake_gateway.py` | stateful stand-in Gateway for tests and local runs before week 3 |
| `db/init/` | first-start DB setup: roles, schemas `credential` / `ballot`, tables, SECURITY DEFINER ballot functions |
| `tests/` | unit tests (39 hash vectors, …) and `test_flow_db.py` (week 2 path on a real DB) |

```bash
# unit tests (no database needed)
cd core && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest -q

# + the week 2 flow on a real database (pv2_core of a DB initialised with db/init)
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://pv2_core:<DB_CORE_PASSWORD>@127.0.0.1:5432/purevoting pytest -q

# full stack with the stand-in Gateway (from the repository root, after copying .env.example to .env)
docker compose --profile mock up --build
docker compose exec -e STAFF_PASSWORD=... core python -m app.scripts.create_staff --username admin1 --org org_commission --role admin
# then http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

The DB init scripts run only when the `pgdata` volume is empty; after changing them use `docker compose down -v`.

Not done yet (later weeks): admin actions, tally, finalize, review relay, the `node` creation check (week 3, needs the
contract ABI), comparing ledger events with the outbox, AI reports, service logs, the web apps.
